    	<h3>What Does a Host do?</h3>
        <p>A web server is a computer that is connected to the internet (World Wide Web) and serves one or more web sites.  To serve a web site, the machine is registered with a Domain Name Server (DNS) and responds to requests to load web pages, transfer files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and other services.  Without a web server, a company or individual cannot make their content available over the net, even with a domain name. (What Is Web Hosting, 2015)</p>
		<p>A web host provides access to a web server to its customers, as well as other associated services, such as domain registration, email, and database support.  The customer's web site may be hosted on a shared server, on a dedicated server, or on a virtual (cloud) server.</p>
        <dl>
        	<dt>Shared Server</dt>
            <dd>A shared server hosts multiple sites, and the sites share the resources of that server. (Hosting Reviews, 2015)</dd>
            <dt>Virtual Private Server (VPS)</dt>
            <dd>VPS contains the best elements of shared hosting and dedicated hosting services. Like shared hosting, VPS puts your website on a server that also has other sites running on it, but there are far fewer sites per server than on shared hosting services. But the VPS has its own operating system, RAM, and ports, so it is not affected by other sites hosted on the server. (Wilson, May 4, 2015)</dd>
            <dt>Dedicated Server</dt>
            <dd>A dedicated server hosts just one site, and is needed when a site has heavy traffic.  Normally, the customer is responsible for setting up the server and maintaining the software on it. (Wilson, Aug 1, 2015)</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <h2>What are the Most Important Characteristics for Web Host Service?</h2>
		<p>A review of several web hosting services revealed a number of different services provided along with just hosting the web site.  Here are the most important ones I identified for an individual or small company getting ready to put out their first web site.</p>
        <dl>
        	<dt>24/7 Customer Support</dt>
            <dd>Most companies provide 24/7 customer support, although the responsiveness varies from a few minutes to up to a half hour. Users that have little knowledge about creating a web site will benefit from quicker response times. (Rashid and Wilson, 2015)</dd>
            <dt>Database Support</dt>
            <dd>Many companies provide a database server and the ability to create a number of databases, either MySQL and/or MSSQL, along with tools for defining the database and creating interfaces to the data.</dd>
            <dt>Choice of Host Operating System</dt>
            <dd>Many services offer a choice of a Linux or Windows based operating system, so if you are planning on using any tools specific to one, such an Microsoft SQL Server, you can pick the appropriate OS.</dd>
            <dt>Site Building Tools</dt>
            <dd>These tools provide templats and formatting tools to make creating a website like putting together a PowerPoint presentation.</dd>
            <dt>Email Accounts</dt>
            <dd>The service normally includes email accounts and service using the domain name for your site.  Some companies limit the number of addresses that can be defined based on the account level.</dd>
            <dt>Security Features</dt>
            <dd>The service should include security updates, brute force detection, firewalls, and anti-DDoS (Distribited Denial of Service) tools to prevent malicious attacks, and offer SSL (Secure Socket Layer), for secure connections to a site.</dd>
            <dt>Storage Space</dt>
            <dd>The amount of storage space allowed varies by service plan and provider, from 10GB at <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1&amp;1</a> to unlimited at <a href="http://www.arvixe.com">Arvixe</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Traffic Limitations</dt>
            <dd>The companies reviewed didn't meter uploads or bandwidth, but the user agreement on <a href="http://www.hostgater.com">HostGator</a> specified that a shared server user would be in violation of the agreement if the site used more than 25% of system resources for longer than 90 seconds. ("Acceptable Use Policy", 2015)</dd>
            <dt>Statistic Reports</dt>
            <dd>Some sites, such as <a href="http://www.arvixe.com">Arvixe</a>, provide statistic reports on web site usage.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>The following table documents the companies and plans considered, and compares the services provided.</p>
        <h2>Comparison of Web Hosting Providers</h2>
        <p>In order to determine which provider would be best, the criteria for selection needs to be defined.  For this project, which would be putting together a web site for a small club that needs a site to: &nbsp;attract new members, showcase upcoming events, and to use a database to track membership and expenses.  With this web site use in mind, the requirements are:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li class="item1">Shared Server</li>
        	<li class="item2">24/7 Customer Support</li>
            <li>Database Support - it can be either MySQL or MS SQL</li>
            <li>Site Building Tools</li>
            <li>Storage - at least 10GB</li>
            <li>Backups of data and/or version control</li>
            <li>Email Accounts - at least 10 included in base price.</li>
            <li>Security Features to prevent unauthorized access</li>
            <li>Low cost</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Reviewing the various providers, it appears that, aside from free hosting for non-profits, InMotion's Launch is the best choice because it meets all the requirements and has the lowest price barring iPage's introductory price, with iPage's Shared with extras coming in second because of it's low introductory price, even though it has restrictions on server space.  The club should go with DreamHost's Shared plan and take advantage of it's free hosting for non-profits.</p>
